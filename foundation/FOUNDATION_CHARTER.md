**Status:** Foundation in Formation  
**Document Type:** Public Charter (Non-Normative)  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Date:** 2025-03-XX

## 1. Purpose

The Conscious Protocol Foundation (“the Foundation”) exists to steward the
**Conscious Protocol** as a public-interest technical framework for the safe,
ethical, and interoperable handling of human inner-state data.

The Foundation’s purpose is to ensure that the Conscious Protocol remains:

- human-centric and sovereignty-preserving  
- technically rigorous and auditable  
- openly developed and publicly accessible  
- independent from control by any single commercial entity  

---

## 2. Scope of Stewardship

The Foundation is responsible for:

- governance of the Conscious Protocol specification  
- maintenance of normative and non-normative documentation  
- versioning, change control, and backward-compatibility principles  
- facilitation of public review and expert contribution  
- alignment with emerging international standards and regulatory frameworks  

The Foundation **does not** develop commercial products or services.

---

## 3. Independence and Neutrality

The Foundation operates as an **independent, non-profit entity** in formation.

No commercial organization may unilaterally control:

- protocol direction  
- specification approval  
- governance decisions  
- compliance interpretation  

All stewardship decisions shall prioritize the public interest and the
protection of human autonomy and psychological integrity.

---

## 4. Relationship to WOKE GLOBAL

**WOKE GLOBAL** is a commercial organization that develops implementations,
tools, and services compatible with the Conscious Protocol.

WOKE GLOBAL:

- may contribute proposals and reference implementations  
- does not control the protocol specification  
- does not possess special governance authority  

This separation ensures a clear distinction between **protocol stewardship**
and **commercial execution**.

---

## 5. Governance Principles

The Foundation is guided by the following principles:

- transparency of decision-making  
- documented rationale for material changes  
- open contribution pathways  
- traceability of protocol evolution  
- respect for human rights and data protection norms  

Governance processes will be published and refined as the Foundation matures.

## 6. Status and Evolution

This Charter represents the **initial public baseline** for the Foundation.

Future revisions may expand governance mechanisms and organizational structure
while preserving continuity, transparency, and backward compatibility.

Publication of this Charter does **not** imply regulatory approval, legal
incorporation, or certification status.

---

## 7. Public Availability

This Charter is published as a public reference document to support:

- regulatory understanding  
- standards collaboration  
- academic and technical review  
- ecosystem trust and accountability
